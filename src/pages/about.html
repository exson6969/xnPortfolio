        <div class="about-me">
             <p>Hello! My name is Amysoj J A Exson Joseph, and I'm a computer science engineering student based in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India. During my time at college, I gained practical experience and honed my skills in various programming languages such as Python, JavaScript, and Dart. Additionally, I have hands-on experience with web development using Python Flask, MongoDB, and various front-end frameworks like Tailwind CSS and React.js.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In terms of professional experience, I worked as a Product Intern at GoX.ai, where I developed code using Node.js for implementing OAuth and retrieving analytical data for Pinterest ads through API calls. This experience enhanced my technical skills and provided me with valuable exposure to real-world software development practices. I have also completed projects that demonstrate my proficiency. These experiences have equipped me with the ability to tackle complex challenges and deliver high-quality solutions. Furthermore, I have actively participated in hackathons, both as part of a team and individually, which have honed my ability to thrive in time-constrained and collaborative environments.</p>
